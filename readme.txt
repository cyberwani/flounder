Flounder is a flat, minimally styled theme for bloggers which features colorful support for post formats and a clean, responsive layout. It supports all currently available post formats, drawing on colors and iconography to set each apart. Flounder is fully responsive, working well on everything from your phone to your large monitor, and is also designed to work seamlessly with many of Jetpack's popular features, such as infinite scroll and enhanced gallery support.
